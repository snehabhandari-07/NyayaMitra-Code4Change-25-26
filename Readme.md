# NyayaMitra  
### Legal Intelligence Dashboard  
*Code4Change 2025 – 2nd Place Winner*

---

## Overview

**NyayaMitra** is a LegalTech dashboard built during the **Code4Change 2025 Hackathon** to address critical inefficiencies in India’s judicial data ecosystem.

The platform transforms complex **NJDG (National Judicial Data Grid)** data into actionable, role-specific insights for **Lawyers, Judges, and Citizens**, while also bridging the transition from **IPC (1860)** to **BNS (2024)**—a major challenge currently faced by legal professionals.
